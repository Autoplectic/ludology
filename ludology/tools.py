    Remove the dominated options of G.

    A left option is dominated if there exists another left option greater than
    it. A right option is dominated if there exists another right option less
    than it. In essence, it would always be a "bad idea" to move to a dominated
    option, because there exists a different option which was objectively and
    strictly superior.

    Parameters

    G : Game
        The Game of interest.

def replace_reversible(G):
    """
    Remove the reversable options of G.

    A left option is reversible if it has a right option which is less than G.
    In this case, that left option can be replaced with it's right option's left options.
    Essentially, this means that if left were to make a move to an option from which right
    has the ability to move to a position which is strictly better for her than G, it is a
    "no brainer" to do so, and so that left option might as well be replaced with the options
    available after right makes the obvious responce.

    Parameters
